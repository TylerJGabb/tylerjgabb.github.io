            As of May 2018 I began working as a Software Development Intern at <a class="paragraphed-link" href="https://hexagonmining.com/">Hexagon Mining</a> where I work with a
            myriad of different languages, primarily C#.
            Although my education is dense, my true passion is Computer Science and Information Technology. If I had to pick a dream job it would be in the field of
            <a class="paragraphed-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechatronics">Mechatronics</a>. Please feel free to navigate the links at the header to find out more about me at your lesiure.

            As a hobby I enjoy exploring the world of 3D rendering within browsers,
            below is a simplistic example of some demos I made for a
            hackathon that I helped host at the <a class="paragraphed-link" href="http://www.arizona.edu/">University of Arizona</a>. This was made around the begining of this year so its probably already outdated!

            I enjoy teaching and consider myself a good educator although I've never professionally held the title. You may browse my personal projects to see examples of the source for these demos -- it has been optimized for teaching.
