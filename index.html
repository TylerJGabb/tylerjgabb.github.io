            Hello! I'm an aspiring Mechanical Engineer and Software Developer.
            In December 2018 I earnened batchelors degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science Emphasis Mathematics.

            As of January 2019 I began working as a Software Engineer at <a class="paragraphed-link" href="https://www.modularmining.com/">Modular Mining</a> where I work with a
            myriad of different languages, primarily Java in a Unix environment.
            Although my education is dense, my true passion is Computer Science and Information Technology. If I had to pick a dream job it would be in the field of

            <a class="bolded">[2019] Distributed Testing System</a><br><br>
            While working at ModularMining I had the opportunity to work on a GreenField project for which I took personal responsibility.
            The goal of this project was to develop a distributed testing system
            that could quickly execute test suites with a scalable resource pool of virtual machines used to split up the testing load.
            A solution was implemented using HTTP and SSH. It took approximately 2 months to develop a working system. The system
            is currently in use and has already reduced testing times by over 75%. <br>

            I enjoy teaching and consider myself a good educator although I've never professionally held the title. You may browse my personal projects to see examples of the source for these demos -- it has been optimized for teaching.
